# SharedPreferences
Shared Preferences to store user preferences.
<br>
<br>
I used this app to test how to implement shared preferences to store what background color the user wants to set in his app. Using this resource when the user open the app, the color always stay there.

This example was used to learn and practice programming techniques in Android Studio in my postgraduate course at UTFPR(Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná).<br>
